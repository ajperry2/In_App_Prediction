# In App Predictions
----
In this repository is code in which a group I was a part of analysed and modeled the probability that a customer will make a purchase in an app. My groups model ended up being a random forest, but we tested gradient boosted forests as well. 

We were working with 20 G of customer data. This included columns on activities of a user in the app.
